#Learning how to incorporate rhino into my shiny server for good coding practices 
#(In other words, forcing me to be a grown-up)

#Working in:
#cstorer@at-3:/huge1/cstorer/ThemeMap/thememap_sserv/

#initialize the project
#rhino::init("RhinoApplication")  #only the first time

#set my working directory;  This needs to be set because rhino won't do it for you
setwd("./RhinoApplication")

#now run the application.
#note that the default 127.0.0.1 is for local access only
#it took a bit to figure out but you need to specify  0.0.0.0
#for clients to connect.  This is kind of the whole point, so I 
#would have thought this would have been more obvious or mentioned 
#in the errors somewhere, but I digress.  Also I am specifying
#the port and telling the app not to try to launch a browser
#window because, well, I am in a unix commandline env.

shiny::runApp(launch.browser = FALSE, port = 3839, host = getOption("shiny.host", "0.0.0.0"))
