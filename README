#In this project I will build a Shiny server to run the ThemeMap application in support of CompBio
#Learn more about CompBio here:  https://becker.wustl.edu/resources/software/compbio/

#The ThemeMap application will act as a conduit between the themes generated in CompBio and the users omics data set
#allowing generation of various visualizations made through the lens of CompoBio Themes.

#The first visualization will be heatmaps using the ComplexHeatmap package.

#creating the git repository
git init thememap_sserv

#rename master to main
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
